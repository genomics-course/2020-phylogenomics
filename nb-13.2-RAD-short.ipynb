    "### What is RAD-seq?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing* is a method for subsampling genomes to concentrate sequenced reads onto particular portions of the genome rather than being spread randomly across the entire genome. In contrast to 'whole-genome sequencing' (WGS) approaches RAD-seq is considered a 'reduced-representation' sequencing method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this term, the RAD methodology itself is not a different form of *sequencing* than we've seen before -- most RAD-seq libraries are sequenced on Illumina or similar devices to produce short reads -- rather, RAD-seq is a protocol for preparing your DNA before you put it on the sequencing machine such that only a subset of regions of the genome will be sequenced.

    "### Why RAD-seq?\n",
    "There are many types of questions we can investigate using genomics that do not require sequencing the entire genome. Most notably, this includes most forms of *comparative genomics* where we are interested in the *differences* between individuals, populations or species. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've discussed before, if you want to know about sequence differences at an individual gene among a number of different species then the most efficient way to answer this is not to sequence their entire genomes. Instead, it is much cheaper to use Sanger sequencing, or to design probes to target just that particular region of the genome (a topic we'll return to later)."

This is OK to do since we've uniquely barcoded the sequences from each individual and so we can separate them later using bioinformatics based on these sequences. Let's generate fragments for four different individuals by using four different barcodes. You can see that we use a random series of six nucleotides as the 4 different barcodes. Ideally, these should be at least two bases different from each other so that even if sequencing errors occur during sequencing we will still be able to assign the reads to samples accurately. "

This refers to steps in the preparation of a genomic library that are required so that the size of fragments that are put onto the sequencing machine are in a proper size range. For Illumina sequencing the fragments should be around 300-1000bp in length. Among the different RADseq library preparation protocols some methods (e.g., GBS and ddRAD) simply select fragments that happen to be in the correct range after restriction digestion. The original RAD method differs by using a *shearing* step, which involves breaking the DNA into smaller pieces. After shearing fragments that have been broken to be near the desired size range are then selected. \n",

    "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method widely used in molecular biology that takes advantage of the process of DNA replication to preferentially replicate some sequences of DNA more than others, and in doing so to enrich a library for the part that we plan to sequence. The preferential replication of some regions over others is accomplished using *primers* which initiate the DNA replication process. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this library we use primers that will amplify any molecule that has **both** the Illumina adapter I and Illumina adapter II at either end. Remember, adapter I is attached to the restriction digested end, and adapter II was ligated to any randomly sheared end. Thus there are many molecules in our library currently that have adapter II at both ends, or sometimes adapter I at both ends. We can effectively remove those by replicating only the molecules that have one sheared end and one digested end (they have both types of adapters). After a few cycles of PCR these molecules will make up almost the entire library. Our function below emulates this by simply removing all oligonucleotides from the library that do not have both adapters. In a real PCR amplification the number of copies of each molecule would increase exponentially with additional cycles. "

Often different variants of a method exist that differ in the types of equipment that are required, and/or in the cost of the reagents that are involved. For example, the cost of a machine to *shear* DNA is quite expensive, as are the adapters that can bind to poly-A labeled sheared ends. An alternative RAD-seq approach called ddRAD has become popular in recent years that avoids this step by instead using two digestion enzymes such that both ends of a DNA fragment can use ligation to attach adapters. \n",

    "We will learn more later about another method for fragmenting genomic DNA called *tagmentation*. This approach uses modified transposomes that have incorporated adapter sequences and insert themselves into a DNA sample to create double-stranded breaks that leave adapters as overhanging ends. Similar to RAD-seq this overhanging end leaves a target that can be used to ligate additional barcodes or tags. We will revisit this method when we return to nanopore sequencing prep methods. "
